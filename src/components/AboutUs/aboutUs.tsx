	            	of type and scrambledit to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
	            	typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
	            	Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
